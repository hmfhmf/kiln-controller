Changes by Mark Tilles, adding some new configurability and functionality, as well as lots more info to the web GUI:

0. Made changes to the web page title, header text etc for my application. Also added a clickable javascript link over the kiln name which causes the kiln-controller system to run underlying scripts to swap between kiln-controller instances in parallel folder paths. I have a dual-oven setup, with physical switches swapping the thermocouple connections between ovens. So that stuff wouldn't likely really be of interest to anyone but me. But other changes and enhancements you might want to look at include:

1. Changed the icon titles to:  Heating   Running     Idle       Hazard     Save 
2. Improved the icons under the titles. Changed some standard background colors (although I used existing css, didn't make new css, so the css format names don't exactly matching where they are being used)
3. Enabled dual color for the Heating icon: if heating at 100%, red; if heating 0% <heating> 100%, yellow.
4. When firing curve is not running, the Idle icon lights up.
5. When a firing curve is running, the Running icon lights up.
6. Fixed the hazard function, as the variable never seemed to reach the picoreflow.js. Now, when the sensor temp reaches within 5 degrees of the shutdown temp, the hazard icon will light. See "Warn at:" info below.
7. Added new fields in the info line: Kiln: Rhode pid=20 70 200 Catch-up: 5/60 Heating %: 0 Warn at: 1265 Emerg off: 1270
   * "Kiln:" - kiln name from config.py
   * "pid=" - the pid values from config.py
   * "Catch-up:" - the catch up value, if enabled; otherwise "off". Plus, I added a new "ignore" temp below which overheating swings will be ignored by catch-up function. This avoids long and unnecessary cool-down pauses when the firing curve start temp is higher than the oven temperature (for axample, my garage here in Stockholm can get very cold in the winter, and this causes an overshoot at the start of the firing unless I change the curves to start very near the oven sensor temperature. But maybe I can continue to pid-tune this out? Anyway, this new ability to ignore overshoots at low temps comes in handy for me.
   * "Heating %" - the live % heating capacity. This is the logged "pid" value (2.00 max = 100%). To do this I fixed the value of "heat" in oven.py so it reaches picoreflow in its entirety; it was previously being swapped out for 0 and 1 and I don't know why since it doesn't seem it would affect system operation by doing this. It was sent in during simulation firing in its entirety though ...
   * "Emerg off:" - the emergency shutdown value from config.py
   * "Warn at:" - the emergency shutdown value from config.py - 5 degrees. At this temp the "Hazard" icon will light. Maybe add email hooks later for extra warning?
8. Fixed the kwh cost estimate, as the kwh cost value was hard-coded and not reaching the picoreflow.js 
9. Added a delayed-start timer function. ButÂ´this feature is in the picoreflow.js, you you must ONLY have one instance of the system open at any time because any click or refresh of the page will cancel the timer. But it seems to work well!  After clicking START you will be asked for a delay time in HOURS. If you enter one, it will display a reminder NOT to refesh the page and on the top line the planned sart time for the firing will be displayed.ther eis NO countdown timer .. don't see a need for this, good enough to know what time the system will fire up.
