Hello friends. I have made a ton of code tweaks from Jasons own code branch, many of which probably are not needed,
just convenient. Some others, though, might be quite useful, like a timer delay for when a kiln firing should start
after clicking the START button. I'm an amateur though, so my code changes might not be 100 percent kosher, but they
seem to work fine. And I apologise, I have only been using GitHub as an archive for myself, so none of this stuff has
been incorporated into Jason’s branch. Maybe someone out there that is a real programmer can take what i have done
and merge what’s most interesting or useful? My web interface and its underlying functionality is quite a bit more
feature rich than the original, and unfortunately I have not taken the time to document any of my changes either.

The only way that I could say that anyone could get it going and fully understand all the changes I have made would
be to download a copy of my code and then get in touch with me so I can demo my system. Like I said, I’m not a true
programmer but I have managed to get things to work the way I like them too.  I am located in Stockholm Sweden, so a
bit different time zone then maybe where you are.
